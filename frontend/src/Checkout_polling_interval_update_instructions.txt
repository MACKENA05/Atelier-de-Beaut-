To manually increase the polling interval for payment status in your Checkout.js component, please follow these steps:

1. Open your frontend/src/components/Checkout.js file.

2. Locate the pollPaymentStatus function. It should look like this:

   const pollPaymentStatus = (orderId, intervalTime = 5000) => {
     const interval = setInterval(async () => {
       // ... existing code ...
     }, intervalTime);
   };

3. Change the default intervalTime value from 5000 (5 seconds) to your desired value, for example 10000 (10 seconds):

   const pollPaymentStatus = (orderId, intervalTime = 10000) => { ... }

4. Also, when calling pollPaymentStatus in your handleNext function, pass the new interval time:

   pollPaymentStatus(createdOrder.id, 10000);

5. Save the file and restart your frontend development server if needed.

This will increase the waiting time between each payment status check, reducing the frequency of API calls.

If you want, I can help you with further assistance or provide a patch file.

Please let me know if you need more help.
